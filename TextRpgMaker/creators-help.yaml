- "TextRpgMaker is an application that helps you create text adventures. All of the information about characters, scenes and items is specified an YAML files. You should start by looking at the demo project distributed along with the application."
- "When looking at the demo project, you may notice that there are .yaml.typ files next to the .yaml ones. TYP is short for TextRpgMaker YAML Preprocessor. In TYP files, you can include other files. This way you do not have to write all of the dialogs into a single file. Instead, you put '#! include <path>' into the .typ, where <path> is not the absolute path to the file but a path relative to the project root (the folder containing project-info.yaml). As of writing this, including a .typ is not supported."
- "You can export a type documentation for the different elements by clicking [Help]->[Creators]->[Export yaml type documentation]."
